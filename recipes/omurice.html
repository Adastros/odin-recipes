    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Omurice is a popular japanese style egg omelet filled with seasoned 
        rice and other fillings such as mushrooms. Omurice can be eaten 
        during any mealtime. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups of cooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 small, boneless chicken breast</li>
        <li>2 mushrooms</li>
        <li>1/2 onion</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable or olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Chop up the mushrooms, onions, garlic, and chicken.  I 
            recommend cooking the chicken in the oven a bit, first, with 
            some seasonings (I just use salt, pepper, and some curry powder), 
            so you won&rsquo;t have to worry about raw chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat up some oil in the pan (USE A MEDIUM/SMALL PAN.  A little 
            smaller than the size of your plate is good. This is important 
            for the egg) to medium low.  Once the oil is hot, add the 
            vegetables and the chicken with 2 teaspoons of the ketchup and 
            2 teaspoons of the soy sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the onion becomes clear, add in the rice, and the rest of 
            the ketchup and soy sauce.  Mix everything together.  Once the 
            rice is hot, and thoroughly mixed with the other ingredients, put 
            it all in a bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put a small amount of oil in the pan, and then pour the beaten 
            eggs into the pan.  Lift up the pan and tilt it around in a 
            circle so that the egg covers all sides of the pan.  Let the egg 
            cook, occasionally lifting up the egg from the sides of the pan 
            to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t stick.  If you can manage it, flip the egg 
            sheet over to cook on the other side.  If you can&rsquo;t, then just turn 
            the heat down to low and wait for the egg to cook all the way 
            through.  You can try to cook the rice into the omelet before it 
            cooks through, but I find it difficult to transfer to the plate if 
            I do it that way.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the egg sheet is cooked, place it onto your plate.  Move it so 
            it is only on one half of the plate (it should be falling off the 
            edge.  Just fold it over or roll that part up for the time being). 
            Place the rice in the middle of the plate, over a bit of the egg 
            sheet.  Then fold the egg sheet over the top of the rice, and tuck 
            it under the other side of the rice.  Put some ketchup on your 
            finished omurice.
