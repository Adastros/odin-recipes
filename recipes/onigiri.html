    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Onigiri is a Japanese food made from white rice formed into triangular 
        or cylindrical shapes and often wrapped in nori. Onigiri can be made with
        different toppings such as spam, tuna, or peas.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Once the rice is cooked and cooled down, all you have to do is 
            shape them.  I have a difficult time with this, so what I&rsquo;ve learned 
            to do is use some plastic wrap.  Put a scoop of rice in the middle of
            the plastic wrap and wrap it up.  <strong>Onigiri Variation #1:</strong>
            If you want to make pea onigiri, like in the picture above, or you want 
            to mix in some furikake, you need to do this before you put the rice in 
            the plastic wrap.  Just take your scoop of rice, put it in a bowl, and 
            mix in your ingredients with a utensil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, the shaping.  Hold the wrapped up rice in your hand.  Cup your 
            hand so it looks like a “U”, and then cup your other hand, 
            perpendicularly, on top of it tightly.  Gently squeeze the rice.  If 
            you&rsquo;re doing it correctly, it should start to look kind of like a 
            triangle.  Then, rotate the rice ball in your hands, so a different 
            point is pointing downward and repeat.  <strong>Onigiri Variation #2:</strong>
            If you want to add a filling, sometime near the end of forming the 
            onigiri, press a dent in the middle of rice with your thumb.  Add your 
            filling, and cover the hole with more rice, and continue forming.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take the rice out of the plastic wrap and form it a few times with 
            your bare hands.  Then place it on a plate, and sprinkle some salt 
            on them.  <strong>Onigiri Variation #3:</strong> You can add nori to 
            just about any type of onigiri.  You&rsquo;ll need to cut up the nori 
            to fit, but you can cut it into any shape you want, be it a larger 
            sheet to cover the entire onigiri, a small little rectangle for just 
            on the bottom, or some cute shapes.  <strong>Onigiri Variation 
            #4:</strong> In addition to the salt, you can sprinkle some sesame 
            seeds or furikake on top, and press it into the rice.  
            <strong>Onigiri Variation #5:</strong> Finally, one of my favorite 
            types of onigiri, yaki onigiri, or grilled onigiri.  Now, 
            I don&rsquo;t have the appropriate small grill to make these, so I 
            make them in the oven.  Just heat your oven up to a low heat, brush 
            some soy sauce onto one side of the onigiri, place it on a cookie 
            sheet, and put it in the oven.  In 10-20 minutes, flip the onigiri 
            over, and brush some more soy sauce onto the other side, and cook it 
            again.  Just keep an eye on it, and cook it until it&rsquo;s slightly 
            crispy on both sides.
